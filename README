Installation and Usage Guide

Introduction

This document provides instructions for installing and running the code.
Installation
To install and run the code, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the Git repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>
Replace <project_directory> with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.


Install Dependencies:
Ensure that Java and WebDriver executables (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver) are installed on your system and their paths are correctly set.
Ensure that TestNG and Selenium WebDriver libraries are included in the project's dependencies.


Running the Code
Once the installation steps are completed, you can run the code by following these steps:
Execute the TestNG Test Suite:
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Locate the TestNG test class (TestNG.java) in the test package.

Right-click on the class and select "Run as TestNG Test" or execute the test suite using Maven or Gradle commands.
Select Browser Option:
Modify the initializeDriver class to include the desired browser option (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
In the test class (TestNG.java), call the initializeDriver method with the chosen browser option.
Review Test Results:
After executing the test suite, review the results in the test output.
TestNG generates detailed test reports that can be accessed to view the test execution status.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or execution, refer to the following resources:
Official documentation for TestNG, Selenium WebDriver, and respective browser drivers.
Check for any error messages in the IDE console or test output.


Here's an updated version of the README document with instructions on how to change the browser and properties in the `config.properties` file:

# Installation and Usage Guide

## Introduction
This document provides instructions for installing and running the code.

## Installation
To install and run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Git repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
   Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that Java and WebDriver executables (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver) are installed on your system and their paths are correctly set.
   - Ensure that TestNG and Selenium WebDriver libraries are included in the project's dependencies.

## Configuring Browser and Properties
Before running the tests, you can configure the browser and other properties in the `config.properties` file:

1. **Changing Browser:**
   - Open the `initializeDriver` class located in the `pages` package.
   - Update the `initializeDriver` method to use the desired browser option (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - Example:
     ```java
     public WebDriver initializeDriver() {
         driver = new ChromeDriver(); // Change to FirefoxDriver() or EdgeDriver() as needed
         driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
         return driver;
     }
     ```

2. **Changing Properties in `config.properties`:**
   - Open the `config.properties` file located in the `config` package.
   - Modify the properties according to your requirements.
   - Example:
     ```
     searchQuery=your_search_query
     applicationUrl=your_application_url
     product=your_product_url
     username=your_username
     phone=your_phone
     password=your_password
     register_page_url=your_register_page_url
     ```

## Running the Code
Once the installation and configuration steps are completed, you can run the code by following the instructions in the previous section.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or execution, refer to the troubleshooting section in the previous version of this document.
